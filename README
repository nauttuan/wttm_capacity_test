########### OVERVIEW ###########
################################

A single execution of "runner.sh" will repeatedly run capacity_test for both
read-only and write-only hardware transactions while varying the stride amount.
Output will be printed to stdout.

The executable "runner.sh" takes a compiler optimization level as argument.

################################
########## HOW TO RUN ##########
################################

Example (testing optimization level 0):
./runner.sh 0

Example (testing optimization level 2):
./runner.sh 2

################################
######## SAMPLE OUTPUT #########
################################

$ ./runner.sh 2
rm -f capacity_test
gcc -std=gnu99 -mrtm -O2 -o capacity_test capacity_test.c
